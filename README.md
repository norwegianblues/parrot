Parrot
======

An extensible simulation environment for connected devices.

Goals
-----
The project aims at developing an environment to ease the development, test, and analysis of connected devices by providing a configurable platform where the device can be developed in a context.

By context we mean the surroundings or backdrop, i.e. other devices, communication channels, and services, that would be part of the device deployment environment. The difference is that in this platform the context constitutes a well defined and controllable dynamic environment that aids in development, testing and analysis rather than contributing to the hardships of embedded development.

The platform will be able to handle a heterogeneous mix of physical devices, sensors, and actuators, emulated devices, sensors, and actuators, data traffic backplane representing the network, and a number of local or real world services. 

There will be bridging available between the platform and the physical world, making possible to hook up physical devices to the platform as well as connecting the platform to the outside world. 

It is important to note that tools for device and service development are not part of the project per se.
